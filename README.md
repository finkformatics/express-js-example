# express-js-example
This is a little example, how to set up a minimal express crud application.

## Purpose
This aims at giving a rough insight to how to implement a web application frontend + backend with node.js, express,
ejs, html, css and javascript.

This is **not** meant to be deployed for production as many parts are strongly simplified to not be too complex.

## Use case
With this application, users can register/subscribe (e.g. to a newsletter), see their registration and unregister again.
